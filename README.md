Hello! My name is Derek and this is my Pokemon Pack Opening Simualtor Game Thing. Essentially, its a pack opening simulator that saves the cards you have pulled in your session.

In order to run this, you are going to need some kind of IDE that is able to run HTML and JS well. I reccomend vscode since thats what I used. 

To run my game, run the home.html file through your browser, and its self explanatory from that point on!

Heres what each file does:

account.html: Will end up being the account page, but currently in development! 
acountstyle.css: Will end up being the style sheet for the account page.
collection.html: The basic front end and back end for the collection page. This is where all the juicy coding for displaying your collection using session storage is. 
collectionstyle.css: The style sheet for the collection page to make everything look pretty.
gacha.html: The log in page I will incorperate into the code later, working on it!
gacharegister.html: The register page that has the same story as the last one. 
gachastyle.css: The eventual style sheet for the register and log in pages.
home.html: The backend and basic front end of the home page. 
homestyle.css: The style sheet for the home page.
mixkit-arcade-game-jump-coin-216.wav: The BOOP! sound effect that you hear when you open a pack. 
packopening.html: The real meat of the game. This is where all the code for opening the packs is. And the basic front end. 
packopeningstyle.css: What makes the pack opening look so pretty and cool when you do it. The style sheet for the pack opening page.
